		<h2>What is RSS?</h2>
		<p>RSS, also known as Really Simple Syndication, enables you to receive
        up-to-date news and information from many of your favorite Internet sites.
        When you subscribe to an RSS feed, the headlines come to you through a
        personalized home page like My Yahoo! or My MSN or a RSS reader of your choice.</p>
		
		<h2>How can I receive an RSS feed?</h2>
		<p> To subscribe to an RSS feed you'll need an RSS reader. My Yahoo! and
        My MSN are both popular choices but many other readers are also available.
        Visit the Google Directory for a list of available readers.</p>
